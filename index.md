## About Me

Through college, I have enjoyed exploring the intersection of **data**, **ai**, and **human behavior** using my knowledge in *math* and *computer science*.


When I'm not in school, I'm probably:
- Practicing guitar
- Driving around with friends
- Playing video games


## Programming Skills

Here are some of the languages and tools I feel most proficient (in order):
1. Ruby on Rails
2. Java
3. Python
4. Jira
5. GitHub

You can see some of my projects [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).
